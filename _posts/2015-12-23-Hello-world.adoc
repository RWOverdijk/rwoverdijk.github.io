# Hello world!
:hp-tags: general

I always commit to blogging, but I never persevere. But then I thought maybe, if it's not wordpress... I'll be more eager to write stuff. So here's my third attempt at starting something reminiscent of a tech / programming / scripting / I'm bored blog.

Happy coding :)
